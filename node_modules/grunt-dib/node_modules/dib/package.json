It works from a locally cloned repository (or even if you have just a folder).\n2. It does not require any kind of git access control inside your Docker container, so perfect for private repositories.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n- package.json: Describe your image by means of a Node module. \n  The package \"name\" will be used for the name of the image.\n  The package \"version\" will be used to tag the image.\n- Dockerfile: Any regular docker file, but you do not have to ADD your files. 'dib' will add all files in the repository to it automatically.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n```\nnpm install -g dib\n```\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nGo to the repository folder (containing package.json and Dockerfile).\nThen execute:\n\n```\ndib\n```\n\nWhich files are added to my image?\n==================================\n\nAll files in the repository are added, except:\n\n- .git/**\n- .gitignore\n- .npmignore\n- Gruntfile.js\n- All files list in .gitignore and .npmignore\n\nThe node_modules folder is pruned for production before creating the image.\nThis is done in a temporary folder, so nothing changes in your original repository.\n\nWhere is my app inside the image?\n=================================\n\nThe entire repository (excluding the files mentioned above) are copied to '/app/' inside the image.\n",
